Video Pixelator - Brandon Lucia - 2011

This program captures video from any camera available and pixelates it into
square regions.

This program was originally built using XCode, with the OpenCV framework.  The
source files can be added to a standard project and compiled.

The included ".app" file will run the program (even though its name is
different from the name of the project).
